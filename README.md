## Usage

### Installing BeauPools

Download [BeauPools.unitypackage](BeauPools.unitypackage) from the repo. Unpack it into your project.

BeauData uses the ``BeauPools`` namespace. You'll need to add the statement ``using BeauPools;`` to the top of any scripts using it.

### Pool Types

There are four types of pools in BeauPools: Fixed, Dynamic, Prefab, and Serializable.

| Pool Type | Capacity | Requires Constructor | Notes |
| ----- | -------| - | - |
| Fixed | Fixed capacity. If allocating from empty pool, an exception is thrown. | ✓ | |
| Dynamic | Dynamic capacity. If allocating from empty pool, a new element will be constructed. | ✓ | |
| Prefab | Dynamic pool (see above). | X | Unity-specific behavior documented [below](#prefabpool). |
| Serializable | Dynamic pool (see above). | X | Similar functionality to Prefab pool, inspector serializable. |

### Creating/Destroying a Pool

```csharp
public class SomeObject { ... }

// -- Creating a FixedPool --

// Max size for the FixedPool
int fixedPoolCapacity = 32;

// Constructor, required for generating pool elements
// This should return identical elements every call
// Pool.DefaultConstructor returns a default constructor for types with empty constructors
Constructor<SomeObject> someObjectConstructor = Pool.DefaultConstructor<SomeObject>();

// Strict typing
// True by default. Set this to false if you don't know
// exactly the type of object being generated by the constructor
bool fixedPoolStrictTyping = true;

// Finally, generating the pool
FixedPool<SomeObject> fixedPool = new FixedPool<SomeObject>( fixedPoolCapacity, someObjectConstructor, fixedPoolStrictTyping );

// -- Creating a DynamicPool --

// You can use more specific constructors if desired
Constructor<SomeObject> customObjectConstructor = (IPool<SomeObject> pool) => { return new SomeObject(); };

DynamicPool<SomeObject> dynamicPool = new DynamicPool<SomeObject>( 16, customObjectConstructor );

// -- Destroying a Pool ---

// To destroy a pool, call Dispose()
fixedPool.Dispose();
dynamicPool.Dispose();
```

### Populating a Pool

By default, pools do not start with any elements. You must prewarm the pool with its initial set of elements.

```csharp
// This will ensure the pool contains 16 elements
somePool.Prewarm( 16 );

// This will fill the pool up to its current capacity.
somePool.Prewarm();
```

You can shrink the number of elements in the pool down as well.

```csharp
// This will ensure the pool contains no more than 16 elements.
somePool.Shrink( 16 );
```

You can also clear a pool of all its elements with ``Clear()``.

### Using a Pool

To allocate an element from the pool, call ``Alloc()``. To return it to the pool, call ``Free( [element] )``.

```csharp
// Allocate the element from the pool
var element = somePool.Alloc();

// Do something with the pooled element
...

// Return the element to the pool
somePool.Free(element);
```

You can also allocate and free in batches.

```csharp
List<SomeObject> objectInUse = new List<SomeObject>();

// This will allocate 16 elements and add them to the list
somePool.Alloc(objectsInUse, 16);

// Do something with those elements
...

// Free them all at once
somePool.Free(objectsInUse);
```

### Callbacks and Events

If your pooled object inherits from the ``IPooledObject<T>`` interface, it will receive certain calls from the pool during the object's lifecycle. These events are ``OnConstruct``, ``OnAlloc``, ``OnFree``, and finally ``OnDestruct``. The ``IPoolConstructHandler`` and ``IPoolAllocHandler`` interfaces also exist to provide non-generic interfaces for receiving these events, regardless of the exact pool type.

```csharp
public class PooledObjectWithCallbacks : IPooledObject<PooledObjectWithCallbacks>
{
	// Called when this object is constructed for the given pool 
	public void OnConstruct(IPool<T> inPool)
    {
		...
	}
    
    // Called when the element is allocated from the pool
    public void OnAlloc()
    {
		...
	}
    
    // Called when the element is returned to the pool
    public void OnFree()
    {
		...
	}
    
    // Called when the element is destroyed from within the pool
    public void OnDestruct()
    {
    	...
    }
}

public class SomeConstructHandler : IPoolConstructHandler
{
    public void OnConstruct()
    {
        ...
    }

    public void OnDestruct()
    {
        ...
    }
}

public class SomeAllocHandler : IPoolAllocHandler
{
    public void OnAlloc()
    {
        ...
    }

    public void OnFree()
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

Some suggested uses for these callbacks:
* Use the ``OnAlloc`` or ``OnFree`` callbacks to help reset state.
* Use ``OnConstruct`` and ``OnDestruct`` to help manage resources in situations where the standard Unity ``Awake`` and ``OnDestroy`` events may not fire (i.e. the object might never be activated)
* Use ``OnConstruct(IPool<T>)`` to remember the pool that owns this object. This would allow you to write a method to return the object to its owning pool.

Every pool also contains an ``PoolConfig`` object. This allows you to register additional callbacks on a per-pool rather than per-element basis. See [PoolConfig Members](#poolconfig-members) below for documentation.

## PrefabPool

### PrefabPool Requirements

PrefabPools are pools intended for instantiating and pooling Unity prefab objects. To this end, they have the following properties.
* New instances are assigned as children of a specific Transform. You should ensure this Transform is disabled to avoid unwanted behaviour from your pooled instances.
* By default, allocated instances are assigned as children of a specific Transform, or the root of the scene if no Transform is provided.
* By default, allocated instances reset their position and orientation on allocation. This can be disabled.
* PrefabPool provides overridden versions of the ``Alloc`` method to mirror some of Unity's ``Instantiate`` methods. See [PrefabPool Members](#prefabpool-members) below for documentation.
* Any components on the prefab or its children that implement the ``IPoolConstructHandler`` or ``IPoolAllocHandler`` will receive pool events (``OnConstruct``, ``OnAlloc``, ``OnFree``, ``OnDestruct``)

### SerializablePool

BeauPools provides the ``SerializablePool`` object for easy setup of a PrefabPool in the inspector. It can be treated as a PrefabPool, and also provides a set of methods for managing all currently allocated/active objects from the pool.

A SerializablePool operates by constructing an internal PrefabPool and performing operations on that pool. The internal pool will be constructed when ``Initialize`` is called. It will also be lazily instantiated if any ``Alloc`` or ``Prewarm`` methods are called. It will not be lazily instantiated if a ``Free`` method is called, and will error if the internal pool is not present.

Note: due to Unity's serialization rules, you must create a subclass of SerializablePool for each type of component you with to pool.

```csharp
// This is necessary, since Unity won't serialize generic classes
[Serializable]
public SomePooledBehaviourPool : SerializablePool<SomePooledBehaviour> { }

public class TestSerializedPool : MonoBehaviour
{
	[SerializeField]
	private SomePooledBehaviorPool myPool;
    
    private void Start()
    {
  		// Initialize can be called before the pool is used, but is not required
		myPool.Initialize();
	}
    
    private void OnDestroy()
    {
    	// Make sure to destroy your pool before it goes out of scope
    	myPool.Destroy();
    }
    
    public SomePooledBehaviour Spawn()
    {
    	// A SerializablePool can be treated like any other pool
    	return myPool.Alloc();
    }
}

```
